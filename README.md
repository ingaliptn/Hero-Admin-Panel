The Hero Admin Panel is built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application communicates with a backend server through RESTful APIs to perform various administrative tasks.

## Features

The Hero Admin Panel offers the following key features:

- **User Management:** Create, update, and delete user accounts. Manage user roles and permissions.
- **Content Management:** Add, edit, and delete content items, such as articles, blog posts, or product listings.
- **Dashboard:** View an overview of system statistics and important metrics.
- **Settings:** Configure system settings, including application preferences and general options.
- **Responsive Design:** The admin panel is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
